A http web server developed by me, and hopefully to run on my own website when it's totally ready.
Now the development is actively moving forward, and is already runnable(static only).

You can contact me by wp.4163196 AT gmail.com, and desperately welcome joining in!

Refactored the ugly code, now it seems more comfortable. thanks for the advices from qin-kiss.
The next task is to complete the basic function of uwsgi module, which is hoped to support dynamic backend such as blog engine.
With this refactor, especially the reuse of functions in http_request.c, the development of uwsgi module is more easy now.
