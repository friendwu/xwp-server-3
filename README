A http web server developed by me, and hopefully to run on my own website when it's totally ready.
Now the development is actively moving forward, and is already runnable(static only).

You can contact me by wp.4163196 AT gmail.com, and desperately welcome joining in!

Refactored the ugly code, now it seems more comfortable. thanks for the advices from qin-kiss.
The next task is to complete the basic function of uwsgi module, which is hoped to support dynamic 
backend such as blog engine. With this refactor, especially the reuse of functions in http_request.c, 
the development of uwsgi module is more easy now.

The basic uwsgi module function has now been completed, so we can converse with the uwsgi backend now! 
I just use it talk with a python written blog engine, and works well.
But after a long time developing with few tests, the code seems quite buggy, so I will stop adding new 
features in the next procedure, and focus on fully tests as well as add enough log to help ease debugging.

the tuned uwsgi module is present now, seems that all things well done, but...I'm not quite sure, it need to
be fully test. the next three tasks is develop log module, add enough log into the code to help me debug
easier, and add some daemonize code.
